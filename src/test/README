sslconnect_test.sh does an end-to-end demo of creating a server
certificate, sending it to the log server and getting back a log
proof, serving the certificate and proof with Apache, and verifying
the log proof.

To run sslconnect_test, you will need to do the following:

1. Compile the log server and client, following the instructions in src/README.

2. To run a test SSL server, you will also need Apache. On Debian based
systems, running

$ sudo apt-get install apache2

should suffice. On other systems, you may also need to modify the
Makefile and/or the httpd.conf.

For the following steps you should be in the directory where
this README resides.

3. Make platform dependent links:

$ make <platform>-links

Currently, linux-links and freebsd-links are defined.

4. Run the test

$ ./sslconnect_test.sh

This first runs client regression tests against existing certificates.
Secondly, the test generates fresh test certificates and tests
a) The submission of certificates and precertificates to the log server,
   and the retrieval of initial Signed Certificate Timestamps;
b) Serving Signed Certificate Timestamps in a TLS handshake; and
c) Retrieving audit proofs for those SCTs from the log server.

In the end, the tests should report something like this:

PASSED 38 tests
FAILED 0 tests
