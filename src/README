To build the log server, you need OpenSSL >= 1.0.0.

To find out your system version of OpenSSL:

$ openssl version

If the system version of OpenSSL is appropriate, then you can simply:

$ make

Else you have to make a local version. To build a local version on
Linux, download and unpack OpenSSL source
(http://www.openssl.org/source/) and, in the openssl directory, run

$ ./config shared
$ make

Then, you can build the log server by pointing to your custom OpenSSL:

$ OPENSSLDIR=<path to openssl directory> make
