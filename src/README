1. To build the log server, you need OpenSSL >= 1.0.0.

To find out your system version of OpenSSL:

$ openssl version

If the system version of OpenSSL is appropriate, then you can simply:

$ make

Else you have to make a local version. To build a local version on
Linux, download and unpack OpenSSL source
(http://www.openssl.org/source/) and, in the openssl directory, run

$ ./config shared
$ make

2. You also need googletest, which you can get from here:
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/list.

Download, unpack and build. On any system this is likely to work on,
this should work:

$ cd make && make && make gtest.a

Our Makefiles are configured to work with this method, and may need
tweaking if you do something different.

Note that if you are on a BSD system "make" will appear to work, but
you'll get a link error. Use "gmake" instead.

3. You will also need protobuf, from:
http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list.

(Tested with protobuf-2.4.1)

Again, download, unpack and build.

4. Then, you can build the log server by pointing to your custom OpenSSL
(if needed), protobuf and gtest:

$ make OPENSSLDIR=<path to openssl> PROTOBUFDIR=<path to protobuf> GTESTDIR=<path to gtest>

Once more, use gmake on BSD systems.

5. Finally, test:

$ make OPENSSLDIR=<path to openssl> PROTOBUFDIR=<path to protobuf> GTESTDIR=<path to gtest> test

6. If you know how to build Apache to test the authz extension, then
first:

$ cd test
$ make APACHEDIR=<path to httpd> local-links

and run tests.
