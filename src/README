To build this, you need OpenSSL >= 1.0.0.

If that means you have to make a local version, then you can point at
it like:

$ OPENSSLDIR=<path to openssl> make

This should work whether you point at an OpenSSL source tree or a
local install.

If the system version of OpenSSL is appropriate, then you can simply:

$ make
