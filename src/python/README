To run the python scripts

1. Install the following additional packages
gflags
gviz-api-py
requests

2. Install mongodb (http://www.mongodb.org) and the pymongo package

3. Install the protoc compiler from https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

4. Run 'make' in the parent python/ directory to
generate the Python versions of CT protocol buffers.

5. Ensure the mongodb server is running. If it's running with
non-default settings then you have to modify command line flags
accordingly.

6. Make sure the python/ directory is on your Python path

7. Try ct/dashboard/dashboard.py
This launches a simple web server for displaying log data, and a
background process for probing the log(s) periodically. The default
output is at http://127.0.0.1:8000
