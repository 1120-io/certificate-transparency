This is the really early beginnings of a CT Log client written in Go, along
with a Log Scanner tool.

You'll need go v1.1 or higher to compile.

Set GOPATH to the directory you found this README me (or run ". ENV"
if you're using a sh compatible shell), and then run:

go get ct/scanner

To fetch all the dependencies.

To compile the log scanner run:

go build ct/scanner/scanner.go
