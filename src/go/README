This is the really early beginnings of a CT Log client written in Go, along
with a Log Scanner tool.

You'll need go v1.1 or higher to compile.

Set GOPATH to the directory you found this README me (or run ". ENV"
if you're using a sh compatible shell), and then run:

  go get ct/*

to fetch all the dependencies.

To compile the log scanner run:

  go build ct/scanner/main/scanner.go

To compile the LCD log display driver run:

  go build ct/schwag/main/display.go

When sending pull requests, please ensure that everything's been run through
gofmt beforehand so we can keep everything nice and tidy.
