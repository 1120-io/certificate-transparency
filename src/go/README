This is the really early beginnings of a CT Log client written in Go, along
with a Log Scanner tool.

You'll need go v1.1 or higher to compile.


Installation:

This go code must be imported into your go workspace before you can use it, you
can do that with:

  go get code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/src/go/client
  go get code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/src/go/scanner
  go get code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/src/go/schwag
  etc.


Building the binaries:

To compile the log scanner run:

  go build code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/src/go/scanner/main/scanner.go

To compile the LCD log display driver run:

  go build code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/src/go/schwag/main/display.go
